# Node Typescript SOLID

SOLID principles project built in Node.js

I'm coding this project while I'm reading the "_Design Principles and Design Patterns_" paper wrote it by our dear **Uncle Bob**.

## Project structure

As we know, there exists 5 design principles and we will abording it at the same order that Robert explanied it.

### Principles of Object Oriented Class Design

- [Open / Close Principle (OCP)](#OCP)
- [The Liskov Substitution principle](#LSP)
- [The Dependenci Inversion Principle](#DIP)
- [The Interface Segregation Principle](#ISP)

#### Open / Close Principle (OCP) {#OCP}

Open close principle covers a simple statement "A module should be open for extension but closed for modification", the next files have an problem example and another with de way to apply OCP.

1. [The Problem](./src/OCP/00_The_Problem.ts)
   `npm run dev:OCP-Problem`
1. [Solution](./src/OCP/01_Solution.ts)
   `npm run dev:OCP-Solution`

#### The Liskov Substitution principle {#LSP}

#### The Dependency Inversion Principle {#DIP}

#### The Interface Segregation Principle {#ISP}
